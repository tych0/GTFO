GTFO is a piece of blogging software, much like wordpress. However, GTFO does
what it says on the tin: it gets out of your way.

In GTFO, there are no web interfaces, no MySQL databases to setup. You write
your blog posts in a text format based on markdown. The directory structure of
your website serves as the layout, and links are permanent unless you move the
files yourself.

GTFO supports:
  * Blogging
  * Static pages
  * Tags
  * Comments
  * Posts grouped by date
  * Recent posts
  * Recent comments

GTFO makes use of CSS for most layout work, so you can customize the look to
your tastes.
