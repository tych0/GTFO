GTFO has the following dependencies:
  webpy: http://webpy.org (tested with 0.34)
  markdown2: https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2

These should be somewhere your python runtime can find them. Additionally, you
can put the gtfo/ subdirectory there too.

dispatcher.py and the associated .htaccess file are for use with Apache. If you
don't use (or don't want to use) Apache, you can start the dispatcher script
directly to run the dispatcher script directly to start the builtin webpy
webserver.

Web content should be placed in the www/ subdirectory as a sibling to your
dispatcher script. The file www/gtfo.conf is special; it is your GTFO config
file. If GTFO can't find one when it starts, it will autogenerate one for you,
so you can change it to your liking.
